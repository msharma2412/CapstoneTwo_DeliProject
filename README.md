The attached image shows how the welcome screen shows up in the terminal along with a piece of code that allows the user to switch between options.

Obstacles programming Main Screeen:
Tried to create a giant do while to envelope the switch statement to create more options on the main screen. Project showed errors when I tried to use add the do while loop and other features into the main menu.

The attached image shows how the chip option shows up in the terminal along with a piece of code that shows a method to calculate chip price that was inherited from the product class

Obstacles programming Chip Screeen:
Getting the chip screen to show the chip options ad formulating an abstract method that returns chip price.

Purpose of section:
DeliUserInterFace:
The DeliUserInterFace class shows users various options pertaining to their order such as bread and topping choice.

The attached image shows how the toated option shows up in the terminal along with a piece of code that shows a boolean method in a switch statement that allows the user to choose between toasted and untoasted bread.

Obstacles programming DeliUserInterFace Screeen:
Very challenging section to code. The menu was only showing the sandwich ingredients.It was not allowing users to create a whole sandwich or calculate price. Tried to include code that would link methods in the DeliUserInterFace to allow user to calculate price. Broke program multiple times. A common was that the class names were missplelled or that I need to write more abstract methods.

Purpose of section:
Drinks:
:
The chip class allows users to choose betwwen drink options or exiting the application.



The attached image shows how the drink option shows up in the terminal along with a piece of code that shows a method to calculate drink price that was inherited from the product class

Obstacles programming Chip Screeen:
