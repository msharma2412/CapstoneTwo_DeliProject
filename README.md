Title: 
Capstone2Deli Project

Purpose of project

To create a simple gui interface that allows users to search between options offered at a deli.

Accessing the Project:

Project can be accessed via github. Intelli J and Java were used to create application.

Sections of project:

The project has a Main, DeliUserInterFace,Sandwich,Drink,Order,Chips,Drink,Receipt,and Product section.

Purpose of section:
Main:
The Main method welcomes users into the application and allows them to choose betwwen continuing or exiting the application.

The attached image shows how the welcome screen shows up in the terminal along with a piece of code that allows the user to switch between options.

Obstacles programming Main Screeen:
Tried to create a giant do while to envelope the switch statement to create more options on the main screen. Project showed errors when I tried to use add the do while loop and other features into the main menu.

Purpose of section:
Main:
The Main method welcomes users into the application and allows them to choose betwwen continuing or exiting the application.

The attached image shows how the chip option shows up in the terminal along with a piece of code that shows a method to calculate chip price that was inherited from the product class

Obstacles programming Chip Screeen:
Getting the chip screen to show the chip options ad formulating an abstract method that returns chip price.

Purpose of section:
DeliUserInterFace:
The DeliUserInterFace class shows users various options pertaining to their order such as bread and topping choice.

The attached image shows how the toated option shows up in the terminal along with a piece of code that shows a boolean method in a switch statement that allows the user to choose between toasted and untoasted bread.

Obstacles programming DeliUserInterFace Screeen:
Very challenging section to code. The menu was only showing the sandwich ingredients.It was not allowing users to create a whole sandwich or calculate price. Tried to include code that would link methods in the DeliUserInterFace to allow user to calculate price. Broke program multiple times. A common was that the class names were missplelled or that I need to write more abstract methods.

Purpose of section:
Drinks:

The drink class allows users to choose betwwen drink options or exiting the application.

The attached image shows how the drink option shows up in the terminal along with a piece of code that shows a method to calculate drink price that was inherited from the product class

Purpose of section:
Orders:
The Orders class contains methods that allow the user to place an actual order. It is a very important part of the application that accepts orders.

The attached image shows ordering option shows up in the terminal along with a piece of code allows a user to place an order

Obstacles programming DeliUserInterFace Screeen:
Very challenging section to code. Had difficulty understanding the purpose of the section. It is a missing a remove order section. Trying to add a method to calculate prices caused it to crash program. 

Purpose of section:
Products:
The products class is the parent class that contains abstract methods that will be inherited by the chip, sandwich, and drink classes. It is a generic class that can describe any type of food. An improperly writtern method will cause the other child classes to work incorrectly.

The attached image shows products in the terminal along with a piece of code that is an abstract method that will affect sandwich, bread, and drinks

Obstacles programming Products Screeen:

Very challenging section to code. Had difficulty understanding the purpose of the section.  Trying to add a method to calculate prices caused it to crash program. 

Purpose of section:
Sandwiches:

The sandwich class allows users to build a sandwhich that can contain different types of bread, vegetables, meats, cheeses, and sauces.Key part of program.Information from this section will determine most of the order prices.

The attached image shows how the drink option shows up in the terminal along with a piece of code that shows a method to calculate drink price that was inherited from the product class

Obstacles programming Sandwich Screeen:
Very challenging section to code. Had difficulty understanding the purpose of the section and where different features belonged. Tried to add a method that added the prices from the other methods. Was not able to connect my order prices to the application.
